An absurdly simple contact form plugin. Just type [contact]. There are no options.

== Description ==
This plugin creates the shortcode [contact] which will insert a small contact form. There are only name, email, subject, and message fields and the email will be sent to the administrator account's email address.

There are no options at all.

== Installation ==
1. Download the latest zip file and extract the `super-simple-contact-form` directory.
2. Upload this directory inside your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the 'Super Simple Contact Form' on the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Type `[contact]` wherever you want a contact form.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a version with a reCaptcha? =
Yes! If you donate a couple bucks I'll send it to you. [Email me](mailto:plugins@shinraholdings.com).

= How do I set the options? =
You don't. There are no options. There's plenty of fancy, bloated contact form plugins out there you can use if you want options. This one works everytime with zero configuration.

= Where does the email go? =
To the administrator email address. You can change this in WordPress' general settings if you need to.

= Why did you make this? =
There were no good, up-to-date lightweight contact form plugins.

= Can you add this feature I just thought of? =
You can ask but I probably won't.

= How do I change the styling? =
You don't **need** to change the CSS styling, but you can if you want.

As of version 1.5.0, the plugin exclusively uses classes and IDs, no more inline styles. So you can change the CSS styles by adding rules for the relevant objects. The default style rules are as follows:

`.sscf-report {}
.sscf-wrapper {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	clear: both;
}
.sscf-input-wrapper {}
.sscf-input-wrapper label {
	width: 100px;
	float: left;
}
.sscf-input-wrapper input {
	width:280px;
}
.sscf-input-wrapper textarea {
	width:280px;
	height: 102px;
}
.sscf-submit {}
.clear {
	height: 0;
	visibility: hidden;
	clear: both;
	display: block;
	width: auto;
}`

There are additional classes and IDs for each item, should you require them, just take a look at the HTML source.


== Screenshots ==
1. The contact form.
2. The message when one of the requried fields (return email address or message) is omitted.
